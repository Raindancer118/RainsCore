/**
 * A SQLite database, as this project uses one.
 *
 * <h2>Why these tests run against a real database</h2>
 * Because a fake that answers the way we expect proves only that we are consistent with ourselves.
 * Everything worth testing here is one of SQLite's own opinions: that foreign keys are <em>off</em>
 * until asked for, that a second writer gets {@code SQLITE_BUSY} rather than waiting, that a
 * rollback really does undo, and that a schema version survives being closed and reopened. None of
 * that can be mocked into being true.
 *
 * <p>The driver is the same one Paper ships, at the same version, in test scope only — so the engine
 * these tests pass against is the engine the server runs.
