/**
 * Rules about which thread work is allowed to happen on, enforced at build time.
 *
 * <h2>Why these are read out of the source</h2>
 * Because the failure they prevent cannot be reproduced in a unit test and is invisible in a normal
 * one. On Folia there is no single main thread: each region ticks on its own, a player is owned by
 * the region they are standing in, and touching them from anywhere else throws
 * {@code IllegalStateException} — sometimes. On Paper the same code is merely a stall. So the bug
 * ships, looks fine on the developer's Paper server, and takes a region down on the server that
 * actually has players on it.
 *
 * <p>The two things that go wrong are always the same two:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Touching a player from the wrong thread.</b> Closing somebody's window, setting a slot in
 *       their inventory — done from wherever the reason happened to arrive, which for a login is the
 *       connection thread and for a quit is somebody else's region.</li>
 *   <li><b>Doing file work on a server thread.</b> Reading and un-gzipping a player file takes long
 *       enough to be felt, and the thread it is taken from is the one running the world.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Neither is caught by a compiler or by any test that does not have a real server with real
 * regions. What <em>can</em> be checked cheaply, here, on every build, is that the calls which must
 * be scheduled are written as scheduled calls. It is a coarse instrument and it is far better than
 * the alternative, which is remembering.
 *
 * <p>The live half — that the scheduler really does put the work where it says — is checked on a
 * running server by {@code RainsCoreTestPlugin}. Neither half replaces the other.
