/**
 * Picking a number without typing it.
 *
 * <h2>Why Core wants one</h2>
 * Six places already need it — an entry fee, its XP levels, the pantry threshold, an effect level, a claim's
 * depth, a fence height — and every one of them had grown its own answer: nudge buttons at ±1 and ±10, which
 * means forty clicks to set a fee of four hundred, or a chat prompt, which closes the menu and loses whatever
 * was half-configured.
 *
 * <p>The old plugin had this right and it was the one screen nobody complained about. Ported rather than
 * reinvented, with the arithmetic pulled out of the screen so it can be tested without a server — which is the
 * half that was never tested before, and the half where every bug was.
 *
 * <h2>The rules</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Clamped, never wrapped.</b> A stepper that turns 400 into the minimum because somebody clicked +100
 *       twice is a stepper nobody trusts.</li>
 *   <li><b>A step that cannot move is shown as unreachable</b> rather than hidden, so the row does not reshuffle
 *       under the cursor as the number changes.</li>
 *   <li><b>Nothing is applied until Accept.</b> Back is the way out, and a dialog that changes nothing until it
 *       is accepted needs no second word for "never mind".</li>
 * </ul>
