/**
 * Every message key the code asks for exists in the file, and every key in the file is asked for.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is worth a test</h2>
 * Because the failure is invisible to the compiler and nearly invisible to a reviewer. A key is a
 * string: rename a line in {@code messages.yml} and the code still compiles, still runs, and shows
 * the player {@code <invsee.opened>} instead of a sentence. Nobody notices until somebody hits that
 * exact path — which, for the messages that matter most, means somebody being refused something.
 *
 * <p>The other direction matters too, if less: a key in the file that nothing ever asks for is a line
 * somebody may spend time translating for no effect, and is usually the leftover of a rename.
 *
 * <h2>How it reads the code</h2>
 * By pattern, over the source. That is coarse — a key built by concatenation cannot be seen, and
 * those are listed below as known exceptions rather than pretended away. It still catches the whole
 * class of mistake that actually happens, which is a literal key that no longer matches the file.
