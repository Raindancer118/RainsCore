/**
 * The window title saying where you are, not just what you are looking at.
 *
 * <h2>Why bother</h2>
 * A chest menu has no other chrome. There is a Back button, but nothing that says what Back goes back to, so
 * three levels into a plugin the title read "Trusted people" and nothing on screen said which claim that
 * belonged to. With the page it was opened from in front of it, the title is the window's only orientation:
 *
 * <pre>
 * RSC » Server › All claims
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>The page wins the budget</h2>
 * A title gets 154 pixels and Minecraft clips it by cutting the <em>end</em> off, which is the worst possible
 * end to lose: joining the names naively produced {@code Claims » claimtrials › Trusted…} — the space went on
 * where you came from and where you are was cut off mid-word.
 *
 * <p>So the parent is included only when both names fit whole, and dropped when they do not. That is the whole
 * contract, and it is why two short names get a trail and two long ones do not. A title that says less beats
 * one that trails off, and the alternative — abbreviating the parent — produces titles nobody can read either.
 *
 * <p>Only ever the immediate parent, never the chain: three names never fit, so a chain would mean the trail
 * silently switched itself off on every deep page.
