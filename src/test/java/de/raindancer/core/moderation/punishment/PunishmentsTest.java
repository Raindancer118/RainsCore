/**
 * Bans, mutes and the record of who did what.
 *
 * <h2>Why a plugin should not write its own</h2>
 * Every plugin that can refuse a player something eventually grows a way of remembering that it
 * refused them. Done separately, that means several files that disagree about whether somebody is
 * muted, several answers to "when does this expire", and no single place to look when a player asks
 * why they cannot build. One system, and any plugin can ask.
 *
 * <h2>What a punishment is</h2>
 * A record that a moderator did something, with a reason and — usually — an end. It is never deleted:
 * lifting a ban <em>adds</em> the lifting, so the history still says what happened. That is the
 * difference between a moderation system and a set of flags.
