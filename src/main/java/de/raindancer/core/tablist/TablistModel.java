/**
 * What the tablist says: who is on, and which world they are in.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is separate from the thing that sends it</h2>
 * The same reason as everywhere else here — sending needs a server, deciding does not. Grouping,
 * ordering, what a world is called, what a player's line says and what the header counts are all
 * decisions somebody will want to change, and none of them should need a server to get right.
 *
 * <h2>Why the sort key is a scoreboard team name</h2>
 * The order of the tablist is not ours to set directly. Minecraft sorts it by the scoreboard team a
 * player is in, alphabetically, and that is the only lever there is. So {@link #sortKey} produces a
 * name that sorts the way the groups do — world first, then player — and {@code Tablists} puts each
 * player in a team called that. It is why the key has a length limit: the server refuses a team name
 * past it, and a refused team is a player who lands in the wrong place with no error.
