/**
 * Is it safe to put a player there — asked the way a plugin actually needs to ask it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this sits on top of {@link SafeSpots}</h2>
 * Because of the one thing that makes the plain check useless in practice: a spot in an unloaded
 * chunk cannot be judged at all, and {@link SafeSpots} deliberately refuses to load anything, since
 * generating terrain to answer "is this warp safe" stops the server for everybody on it.
 *
 * <p>So the answer to "the chunk is not loaded" is not to shrug and it is not to load it on the main
 * thread. It is to bring the ground in first, off the main thread, and then judge — which is what
 * this does. A plugin calls {@link #findSafe} and gets a spot or an honest nothing; the loading, the
 * threading and the giving up are handled once here rather than badly in nine places.
 *
 * <h2>What it will not do</h2>
 * It never force-loads. A check is a look, and a look is not a reason to tick a chunk for the rest of
 * the server's life — that is {@link ChunkHolds#keep}, and it is a decision a plugin makes
 * deliberately with its name attached.
 *
 * <h2>Threads — read this before calling {@link #findSafe}</h2>
 * It is asynchronous, and you must <b>never</b> {@code join()} or {@code get()} it on the server
 * thread. Loading a chunk completes <em>on</em> that thread, so a thread waiting for it is a thread
 * blocking the very work it is waiting for: the server hangs until the watchdog kills it, with no
 * exception and nothing in the log to say why.
 *
 * <p>That is not hypothetical. It is how this paragraph came to be written — a live-server check
 * called {@code .join()} and the server stopped dead. Use {@code thenAccept}, and note that the
 * callback arrives on whatever thread finished the load, so hop back before touching the world:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * core.safety().findSafe(spot, 8).thenAccept(found -> Scheduling.global(plugin, () ->
 *         found.ifPresentOrElse(this::teleportTo, this::refuse)));
 * }</pre>
