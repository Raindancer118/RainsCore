/**
 * Working out who actually attacked, and cancelling the ones that are not allowed.
 *
 * <h2>Why this class is the hard part</h2>
 * {@link Combat} decides what is allowed and is ten lines of arithmetic. This decides <em>who did
 * it</em>, and that is where every PvP plugin has ever gone wrong, because the server does not say.
 * The event names whatever object delivered the damage:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an <b>arrow</b>, a trident, a snowball, an ender pearl — the shooter is behind it, and a rule
 *       that only checks the damager lets anybody shoot their way past PvP being off;</li>
 *   <li>a <b>wolf</b> or a tamed cat — the owner set it on somebody, and treating it as a mob turns
 *       PvP into "bring a dog";</li>
 *   <li>a block of <b>primed TNT</b> — whoever lit it, which may be somebody who has since left;</li>
 *   <li>a <b>lingering potion's cloud</b>, which is not the thrower and not a projectile either;</li>
 *   <li>a <b>fishing rod</b>, a firework, a wind charge, a llama's spit, a wither skull — all
 *       {@code Projectile}, so all one case;</li>
 *   <li>a <b>bolt of lightning</b> from a channelling trident, which is not a projectile and not
 *       alive: without following it, a trident is the cleanest way round a PvP rule in the game;</li>
 *   <li>an evoker's <b>fangs</b> or its <b>vexes</b>, which are summoned rather than thrown.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each of those has to be followed back to whoever is responsible, and the chain can be more than
 * one link long: a wolf shot by an arrow fired by a player.
 *
 * <p>The list is not from memory. Every type in Paper 26.2 that can name somebody behind it —
 * {@code getShooter}, {@code getSource}, {@code getOwner}, {@code getCausingEntity} — was read off the
 * API, and all of them are handled: {@code Projectile}, {@code AreaEffectCloud}, {@code TNTPrimed},
 * {@code Tameable}, {@code EvokerFangs}, {@code Vex}, {@code LightningStrike}. The one deliberately
 * left out is {@code Item#getThrower}, which is a dropped item and does not do damage.
 *
 * <h2>Two more things it gets right on purpose</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Splash and lingering potions are their own event.</b> A splash of harming hits everybody in
 *       range at once and never produces a damage event naming the thrower, so a plugin listening only
 *       to damage lets a potion do what a sword may not.</li>
 *   <li><b>The refusal is told to the attacker, once.</b> A cancelled event with no message is a
 *       player hitting somebody harder and concluding the server is broken; a message per swing is
 *       chat somebody has to leave to escape. So: throttled, and only ever to the person who did it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Priority, in two passes</h2>
 * Decided at {@code LOW}, explained at {@code MONITOR}. Low so a plugin with a more specific opinion —
 * an arena inside a peaceful world — can still see the event and un-cancel it; monitor because that is
 * the only point at which "was this refused" has an answer that will not change. Doing both at once was
 * the first version, and it told people PvP was off while the hit landed.
 *
 * <p>Cancelled events are deliberately <em>not</em> ignored. Something else may have refused first — a
 * claim at {@code LOWEST} — and a player refused in silence concludes the server is broken, so they are
 * told {@code PROTECTED}: something is protecting that, and this does not claim to know whose rule it
 * was.
