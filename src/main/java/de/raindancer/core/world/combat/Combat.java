/**
 * Who may hurt whom on this server.
 *
 * <h2>What this is for</h2>
 * Turning PvP off, turning mobs off, or turning either off in one world and not another — without
 * every plugin that wants it writing its own damage listener. Three plugins each cancelling
 * {@code EntityDamageByEntityEvent} at their own priority is how one of them silently loses, and
 * which one depends on load order.
 *
 * <h2>Two things it deliberately does not do</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It changes nothing until asked.</b> A library that switches PvP off the moment it is
 *       installed has broken somebody's server, and they will not know which plugin did it.</li>
 *   <li><b>It never refuses the world itself.</b> Falling, drowning, lava, a cactus — nobody is
 *       behind those, and a plugin that stops them has turned off the game rather than a rule.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Where "who attacked" comes from</h2>
 * Not from here. The server names whatever delivered the damage — an arrow, a wolf, a splash of
 * potion, a block of TNT — and a rule written against that is a rule anybody can walk around by
 * shooting instead of hitting. Following the chain back to a person is {@link CombatListener}'s job,
 * and it is the part that is easy to get wrong; this class only decides what to do about the answer.
 *
 * <p>That split is also what makes the rules testable without a server, which matters because the
 * rules have two opposite failure modes: too permissive is an argument between players, too strict is
 * somebody unable to mine with their own TNT.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread, and read from every region thread on every hit. Nothing here allocates or
 * locks: a damage event is one of the most frequent things a server does.
