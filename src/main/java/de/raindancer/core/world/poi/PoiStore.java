/**
 * Every place any plugin has asked to remember.
 *
 * <h2>Why one store</h2>
 * There were three, behind three records with the same fields: homes had its own YAML, the ghast
 * lines had theirs, the teleport module had a third. Three answers to the same questions — what
 * happens when a world is gone, when a file is half-written, when two threads save at once — and
 * only one of the three had good answers to all of them. One store means a place saved by any plugin
 * can be listed, flown to or drawn on a map by any other, which is what makes a ghast line able to
 * fly somebody to their own home.
 *
 * <h2>Writing</h2>
 * Changes are held in memory and written when {@link #flush()} is called — on a timer, and at
 * shutdown. Writing on every change would put a disk write on the main thread every time somebody
 * sets a home; writing only at shutdown would lose everything on a crash. {@link #isDirty()} means
 * an idle server writes nothing at all.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. The places are a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}, and a flush takes a snapshot
 * rather than holding a lock across the disk write.
