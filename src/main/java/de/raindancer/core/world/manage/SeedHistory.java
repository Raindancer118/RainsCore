/**
 * Every seed a world has had.
 *
 * <h2>Why anybody needs this</h2>
 * A regenerated world's old seed exists nowhere else: the {@code level.dat} it was in is the first thing
 * deleted. "The map before last had a great village" is only something a server can go back to if
 * somebody wrote the seed down before the folder went — so {@link WorldRegenerator} does, every time,
 * and this is where it goes.
 *
 * <h2>Writing</h2>
 * The same arrangement as {@code PoiStore}: kept in memory, and written by {@link #flush()} — on Core's
 * saving timer and at shutdown — never on the thread that is regenerating the world. Rows are only ever
 * added, so a flush is an insert of whatever is queued and nothing else.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread.
