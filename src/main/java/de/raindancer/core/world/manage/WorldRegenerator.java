/**
 * Creating, deleting and regenerating a world, generically — the one place any of the three has to be
 * gotten right, so a module needing "make sure this world exists" or "wipe this one for a fresh
 * attempt" reaches for this instead of writing its own copy of unload-then-delete-then-recreate.
 *
 * <h2>Seeds</h2>
 * By default none is set: a plain regeneration is a wipe, not a "restore this exact map" tool, and a
 * fixed seed would make every regeneration of a world identical to the last — only occasionally what
 * somebody wants, and surprising the rest of the time. The overloads taking a {@link WorldSeed} are
 * for when it <em>is</em> wanted: the map it had, or a seed somebody chose.
 *
 * <p>Handed a {@link SeedHistory}, every seed passing through here is written down — the outgoing one
 * <em>before</em> its folder is deleted, since after that it exists nowhere, and the new one once the
 * world is back. Without one nothing is recorded, which is what a test or a caller outside a running
 * Core wants.
 *
 * <h2>Order of operations, and why it is fixed</h2>
 * Evacuate whoever is standing in it — back to wherever {@link WorldEntryPoints} last saw them before
 * they arrived, not a generic spawn — wait for every one of those moves to actually land, unload
 * without saving, delete the folder deepest-first, then create again. Each step exists for a reason:
 * teleporting after the unload would fail (the world is gone), saving before deleting would spend time
 * writing chunks that are about to be thrown away, deleting before the world is unloaded fights the OS
 * over files the server still has open, and unloading before every occupant has actually left is
 * either refused by Bukkit outright or strands whoever's teleport had not yet landed.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@link #delete} and {@link #regenerate} take a callback</h2>
 * Waiting for occupants to actually arrive somewhere is asynchronous — {@link Player#teleportAsync}
 * is the only safe way to move someone across worlds at all, let alone on Folia — so there is no
 * synchronous answer to give back. A caller with nobody to evacuate still gets its answer on the same
 * tick; one with occupants gets it once their teleports resolve.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Every callback runs on the main thread (a {@link Player#teleportAsync} future completes there), so
 * touching Bukkit API from inside one is safe. Everything else here — {@link #create}, and {@link #delete}
 * for an already-empty world — still requires being called from the main thread in the first place;
 * creating, unloading and deleting a world are main-thread-only operations in Paper regardless.
