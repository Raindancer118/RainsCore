/**
 * Keeping the people inside a private area out of sight.
 *
 * <p>The {@link LandFlag#VISIBLE_FROM_OUTSIDE} flag. A walled garden is not private if everybody outside can
 * watch you in it, and no permission covers that — it is not about what anybody may <em>do</em>.
 *
 * <h2>Hidden, not merely omitted</h2>
 * {@code Player.hide} rather than suppressing a packet or leaving somebody off a list: hiding a player is a
 * promise a dozen subsystems have to keep, and every place it usually leaks is a place that did half of it. This
 * way the client is genuinely not told they are there.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is recomputed rather than tracked</h2>
 * Both ends move. A watcher walking past a private garden and a resident walking into one are the same change
 * seen from opposite sides, so the pairing is worked out from where everybody is at the moment it is asked
 * rather than remembered — remembering it is how somebody ends up permanently invisible after a disconnect.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is undone by {@link #reveal}, which the plugin calls on shutdown. A player left hidden by a
 * reload is invisible until they reconnect, and nothing on their screen would explain why.
