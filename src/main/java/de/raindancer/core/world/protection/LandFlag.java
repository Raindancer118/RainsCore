/**
 * Area-wide protection switches: how the world behaves on a piece of protected ground.
 *
 * <p>The boolean a flag carries always means "this thing is allowed". A server owner can force one to a
 * fixed value or stop enforcing it entirely — see {@link FlagPolicy}.
 *
 * <p>A flag is either <em>audience aware</em> or area-wide. An audience-aware flag governs something that
 * happens <em>to a person</em> — fall damage, PvP — and so carries one value per {@link LandAudience}, which
 * is what lets an owner be spared what a stranger is not. Everything else describes the world itself (fire,
 * decay, pistons) and cannot sensibly differ per onlooker, so it carries one value for everybody.
 *
 * <h2>No wording here</h2>
 * A flag has an identity, a default and an icon. What it is <em>called</em> is not its business, and used to
 * be: every name and description here read "… inside the claim", which is wrong in Core twice over — it
 * assumes the ground is a claim, and it hard-codes English into an enum.
 *
 * <p>So the label comes from {@link de.raindancer.core.ui.messages.Messages} under
 * {@code land.flag.<key>.name} and {@code land.flag.<key>.description}. Core ships neutral wording — "inside
 * the area" — and a plugin that knows better says so:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // the claims module, on enable
 * messages.define("land.flag.pvp.description", "Players may damage each other inside this claim");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Which also means the server owner can reword any of them in {@code messages.yml}, and their edit beats
 * both defaults — the whole point of that four-layer arrangement.
