/**
 * "May this player do that here?" — asked by anybody, answered by whoever owns the ground.
 *
 * <h2>What Core owns and what it does not</h2>
 * Core owns the <em>question</em>: the vocabulary ({@link LandAction}, {@link LandFlag},
 * {@link LandAudience}), the server's policy over flags, the enforcement listeners, and the throttled refusal
 * a player sees. It owns none of the data. Which piece of ground is where, who is trusted on it and what it is
 * called all come from a {@link LandProvider} that another plugin registers.
 *
 * <p>That split corrects an earlier design in which Core held a whole claim model — shape, members, bans,
 * pantry, bank, fence, entry fee. Those are what a claim <em>is</em>, and a foundation that knows them cannot
 * host anything that is not a claim.
 *
 * <h2>Why every plugin should ask</h2>
 * Because more than one thing moves players and changes blocks: a warp pointing into somebody's house, a
 * teleport request accepted across a border, a ghast line landing in a stranger's garden, a farm world about
 * to be regenerated with builds in it. Each of those has to ask, and before this each either asked nobody or
 * wrote its own rules.
 *
 * <h2>Not knowing is an answer</h2>
 * With no provider registered every question answers {@link LandVerdict#UNKNOWN} rather than "allowed". The
 * difference decides whether an uninstalled module means "nothing is protected, go ahead and delete the
 * world" or "I cannot tell, so don't". See {@link LandVerdict}.
