/**
 * The flag decisions an admin made, on disk.
 *
 * <p>{@link LandPolicies} lives in memory and starts from what each flag says about itself. Without this,
 * turning a flag off lasted until the next restart — which is worse than not offering the setting at all,
 * because the server then behaves differently after a restart than it did before one and nothing says why.
 *
 * <h2>What gets written</h2>
 * Only what differs from the built-in behaviour. A file naming all twenty-eight flags at their default
 * values is unreadable for the two lines that matter, and it freezes those defaults: improve one in a
 * release and every existing server keeps the old value forever, because their file spells it out.
 *
 * <p>The shape is the one the standalone plugin already used —
 *
 * <pre>
 * flags:
 *   pvp:
 *     policy: forced-off
 *     default: false
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>— so an upgrading server's {@code config.yml} can be pointed straight at this and keeps meaning what
 * it said. That file is the only record of what its admin decided.
 *
 * <h2>What a bad line costs</h2>
 * A flag this version does not have, and a policy word nobody recognises, are both skipped rather than
 * guessed at or thrown over. One stale key must not cost an admin every other decision in the file, and
 * guessing at a protection setting is how a server ends up unprotected quietly. A file that will not parse
 * at all is reported through {@link #problem()} rather than passed off as an empty one.
