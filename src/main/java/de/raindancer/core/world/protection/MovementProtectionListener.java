/**
 * Turning somebody back at the border.
 *
 * <p>The {@link LandFlag#WALK_IN} flag, which is what makes the way-in flags a complete set: without it an owner
 * can close teleporting, pearling, elytra and riptide and still have people wander through the front gate.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is Core's and not the region plugin's</h2>
 * Because the flag is. A claims module, an arena and a plot world all want "this tier may not come in", and
 * three implementations of it would be three slightly different ideas of what crossing a border means. What the
 * region plugin still owns is <em>where</em> the border is — this asks {@link Land} and does not know.
 *
 * <p>Only the block position is looked at, and only when it changes. A player standing still generates a move
 * event several times a second, and answering it properly each time is a claim lookup per tick per player.
