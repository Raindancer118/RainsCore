/**
 * Every table this library keeps, and the order they came into being in.
 *
 * <h2>What is in here and what is deliberately not</h2>
 * A database earns its place for data the <em>server</em> writes: warps somebody set, a ban somebody
 * handed out, an achievement somebody earned, the state of a farm world. That data is written while
 * players are on, is never edited by hand, and losing half of it to a kill mid-save is a real
 * incident.
 *
 * <p>It does not earn its place for data a <em>person</em> writes. {@code config.yml}, the custom
 * item definitions and the loot tables are authored by whoever runs the server, read at startup, and
 * meant to be opened in an editor with comments in them. Putting those in a database would take away
 * the only interface they have and give nothing back: they are not written under load, they are not
 * queried, and there is nothing to lose halfway through. Those stay as files — see
 * {@code data.store.YamlStore}, which is still the right tool for exactly that job.
 *
 * <p>So the line is not "files are old and databases are new". It is: <b>what the server writes goes
 * in the database, what a human writes stays in a file.</b>
 *
 * <h2>The rule about editing this list</h2>
 * Steps never change once they have shipped, and are never reordered or removed — only appended to.
 * See {@link Schema} for why. A mistake in a shipped step is corrected by a new step, not by editing
 * the old one.
