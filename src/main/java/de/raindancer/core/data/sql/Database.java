/**
 * One SQLite database file, as this project uses one.
 *
 * <h2>Why SQLite, and why no dependency</h2>
 * Paper carries {@code org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc} inside its own jar, so the driver is already on every
 * server this runs on. That is the whole reason this is possible without breaking the rule that this
 * library downloads nothing at startup: real SQL, real indexes, real transactions, and nothing
 * declared. Checked on a running server rather than assumed — see the sqlite checks in the test
 * plugin.
 *
 * <p>A database file also survives the thing YAML does not: a server killed mid-save. There is no
 * point at which the file is half a database.
 *
 * <h2>The four settings that matter, and why each one is not the default</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Write-ahead logging.</b> Without it a reader and a writer lock each other out, so one
 *       plugin saving warps stalls another reading them. With it they never meet.</li>
 *   <li><b>Foreign keys on.</b> SQLite ignores them unless asked — a declared relationship is
 *       otherwise a comment, and the row it points at can be deleted underneath it.</li>
 *   <li><b>A busy timeout.</b> SQLite's answer to a contended write is not to wait but to fail with
 *       {@code SQLITE_BUSY}. A timeout turns that into waiting its turn, which is what every caller
 *       assumed it did.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code synchronous=FULL}.</b> Slower than the alternative by an fsync per commit, and the
 *       alternative loses the last few transactions when the machine loses power. These transactions
 *       are somebody's homes and somebody's ban record; the fsync is worth it, and this is not a
 *       database doing thousands of writes a second.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>One writer, several readers</h2>
 * SQLite allows exactly one writer at a time whatever this class does, so writes are queued on one
 * connection behind one lock. Pretending otherwise does not make it parallel; it makes it fail
 * intermittently under load, which is the worst way for it to fail. Reads come from a small pool and
 * genuinely do run at the same time.
 *
 * <h2>Errors are answers</h2>
 * Nothing here throws. A write answers whether it happened, a read answers what it found or nothing,
 * and the reason goes to the log. A store that has to catch {@link SQLException} around every call
 * is a store where one of them will not, and a plugin that dies because a query failed takes a
 * server down over a warp nobody was looking at.
