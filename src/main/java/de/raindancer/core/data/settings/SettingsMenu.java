/**
 * The settings, as a window.
 *
 * <h2>What this class is allowed to decide</h2>
 * Nothing. {@link SettingsNavigation} works out which page shows what, what the trail says and
 * whether a click can change a value; this turns that into buttons. Every rule worth a test lives on
 * the other side of that line, which is why there is no {@code SettingsMenuTest} — there would be
 * nothing in it but Bukkit.
 *
 * <h2>The shape of a page</h2>
 * Categories go in the bands, so a page of six subtopics reads as six doors rather than a grid.
 * Settings go in a grid, because a page of them is a list of equal things. A page holding both puts
 * the categories in the top band and the settings below, which is the order somebody reads in.

     * it is in the path, so it is derived from the path.
     *
     * <p>Recursive, and it terminates: every step drops a segment, and the root has no path at all.
     * Building the chain is cheap — a {@link SettingsPage} is a lookup in a tree that is already in
     * memory, and nothing is drawn until somebody actually presses Back.
