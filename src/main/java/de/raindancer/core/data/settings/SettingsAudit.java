/**
 * What is wrong with a configuration that nothing else can notice.
 *
 * <h2>The gap this fills</h2>
 * {@link SettingsStore} already catches everything wrong with a settings <em>file</em>: a value of the
 * wrong type, a number outside its range, a key that is missing, YAML that will not parse. Every one of
 * those is about a single setting, and every one has a right answer the store can apply on its own.
 *
 * <p>The mistakes that survive all of that are the ones where <b>each value is individually valid and the
 * combination is wrong</b>. A world border told to close slower than the round is long. A cooldown longer
 * than the thing it gates. A minimum above its own maximum. A schedule whose later entries fall past the
 * end of the event. Nothing throws, nothing is out of range, the plugin comes up perfectly healthy — and it
 * is not the thing that was configured.
 *
 * <p>Those cannot be found by a schema, because they are not properties of a setting. They are properties
 * of a plugin's own subject matter, so only the plugin can work them out. What Core can do — and what this
 * is — is give every plugin the same shape to say them in, and the same place they come out.
 *
 * <h2>Why they are warnings and never refusals</h2>
 * Because every one of them is a judgement about how something will behave rather than a fact about
 * whether it can run, and an owner may have chosen any of them deliberately. A plugin that refused to start
 * over one would be deciding what somebody's server is.
 *
 * <p>So this logs and returns. The one thing it will not do is stay quiet: the whole value is being read
 * the evening before by whoever set it up, rather than discovered while it matters.
 *
 * <h2>The failure this class has to avoid itself</h2>
 * <b>Crying wolf.</b> A block of warnings that is routinely wrong gets scrolled past, including the line
 * that was right — which leaves a server worse off than having no audit at all. Two things follow, and both
 * are the caller's responsibility rather than something this can enforce:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A normal starting state is not a finding.</b> A fresh install with nothing configured yet must
 *       produce an empty audit, or the warning block appears on every first boot and is learned as noise.</li>
 *   <li><b>Every message says what to do.</b> "border.max-edge-speed is low" is not actionable;
 *       "the border cannot finish closing before the 180 min round ends — trigger the last phase earlier or
 *       raise the ceiling above 1.25" is.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Using it</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * SettingsAudit audit = new SettingsAudit();
 * if (runUp.compareTo(round) >= 0) {
 *     audit.broken("The countdown and grace period together are %s, which is the whole %s round."
 *             .formatted(describe(runUp), describe(round)));
 * }
 * if (waves.compareTo(round) > 0) {
 *     audit.questionable("The later monster waves fall past the end of the round and will never arrive.");
 * }
 * audit.report(log, "This configuration");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe, and deliberately not: an audit is built in one go by one caller, usually during
 * {@code onEnable}, and then read. Making it safe for concurrent use would suggest it was meant to be held
 * on to, which it is not — it is a value describing one moment's configuration.
