/**
 * Typing a settings value in chat.
 *
 * <h2>Why chat and not an anvil</h2>
 * An anvil rename is the usual trick and it is worse here: it cannot show what the value is now, nor
 * what it is allowed to be, and both matter more than not leaving the window. So the menu closes,
 * says what it wants along with the current value and the range, and waits for one line.
 *
 * <h2>Why it does not listen to chat itself</h2>
 * It used to, and that was a bug waiting for company: the claims module and the Hunger Games each
 * had their own chat-input listener too, and three listeners all claiming the next line a player
 * types is three plugins fighting over one answer. {@link ChatPrompts} owns that now — this only
 * asks. The line still never reaches chat, and the reply still happens on a thread that may touch
 * the world, because a chat event's does not.
