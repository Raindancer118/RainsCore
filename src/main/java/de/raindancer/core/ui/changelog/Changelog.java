 *
 * <p>Entries are written by hand in {@code changelog.yml} and stay drafts — seen by nobody but staff
 * previewing them — until somebody publishes one. Publishing is the release: the time goes into the file and
 * from then on everybody who comes back is shown it. Per player only one number is kept, when they were last
 * told, so a new entry needs nothing written per player. Thread-safe.
