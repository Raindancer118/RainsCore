/**
 * Who a player is, as everybody else sees them.
 *
 * <h2>Why chat and the nametag are separate</h2>
 * They look like the same thing and they are not. A chat line is a component the server builds and
 * can make as long as it likes; a nametag is drawn by the client above a moving head, has no room
 * for a sentence, and on a vanilla client is one line. So a player carries a rank prefix in both, a
 * decorative suffix in chat only, and something short above their head — and the two are set
 * independently, with the nametag falling back to the chat prefix when nobody has bothered.
 *
 * <h2>Why prefixes are stored as MiniMessage and names never are</h2>
 * A prefix is something an administrator wrote, and being able to colour it is the entire point, so
 * it is stored as markup and parsed. A player's <em>name</em> is not: it is inserted as plain text,
 * so somebody calling themselves {@code <red>} shows up as nine characters instead of recolouring
 * everybody's chat. That distinction is the one thing in this class worth getting right.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. Identities are a {@link ConcurrentHashMap} and a flush takes a snapshot.
