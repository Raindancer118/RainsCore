/**
 * Who gets a player's sidebar.
 *
 * <h2>What this adds to the copied-in FastBoard</h2>
 * FastBoard solves the hard half: it writes the scoreboard packets directly, so the sidebar does not
 * flicker, can be written from any thread, and does not fight other plugins over Bukkit's team API.
 * What it deliberately leaves alone is <em>who gets the sidebar</em> — not a library's business, but
 * very much this server's, because a player has one sidebar and the claims module wanting to show
 * whose land this is while a ghast flight wants to show its progress is exactly the collision the
 * action bar had. Same answer as there: an owner, a priority, and whatever was interrupted comes
 * back when the winner goes away.
 *
 * <h2>A sidebar is decoration</h2>
 * FastBoard is raw reflection into the server's internals, so on a Paper build it does not recognise
 * even <em>touching</em> the class throws {@link ExceptionInInitializerError} out of a static block.
 * Unwrapped, that takes down whichever listener touched it. Nothing about a sidebar is worth a
 * broken plugin, so every call here is allowed to degrade to doing nothing — once, loudly, in the
 * log, and then quietly, because a plugin ticking a sidebar on a server that cannot draw one must
 * not cost a reflection failure every tick.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread, which on Folia means every thread. The same discipline as
 * {@link de.raindancer.core.ui.actionbar.ActionBars}: a {@link ConcurrentHashMap} of per-player slots,
 * each mutated only under its own lock, and a writer re-checks the map under that lock so a slot
 * removed underneath it cannot be resurrected as an orphan.
