/**
 * One cue: what it plays, and every way to change it.
 *
 * <h2>Why there are two ways to set a sound and both are needed</h2>
 * A chooser gives you one sound out of everything the server has, browsable and auditioned as you go. That is
 * the right tool for a click, a page turn, a refusal — and it is useless for a cannon, because a cannon is
 * fifteen sounds with volumes, pitches and delays, and no picker will ever express that.
 *
 * <p>So the layers are typed, in the notation {@link SoundSequence} reads — which is not a compromise but the
 * thing server owners were already writing by hand in config files. What is new is that a mistake in it is
 * <em>reported</em>: {@link SoundSequence#problemsIn} names the layer it could not read, so a typo costs that
 * layer and says so, rather than silently producing a quieter cue than the one on the screen.
 *
 * <h2>Why "back to default" exists</h2>
 * Because the alternative to a wrong rebinding is remembering what it was, and nobody does. A cue that can be
 * put back is one somebody will experiment with; a cue that cannot is one they leave alone.
