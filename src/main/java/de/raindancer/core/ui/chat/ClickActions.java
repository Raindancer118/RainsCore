/**
 * Server-side actions behind clickable chat buttons.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * A chat component cannot call code. All it can ask the client to do is <em>type a command</em>, so
 * a button that does something on the server needs a command to point at — and both of the obvious
 * ways to arrange that are bad:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A command per feature.</b> {@code /townaccept <id>}, {@code /claimfeeaccept <id>},
 *       {@code /tpaccept}, … Every button anybody ever adds becomes a command in the server's help,
 *       in tab completion, and in the list of things a player can type wrong.</li>
 *   <li><b>Arguments in the command text.</b> The player can read their own chat, so a button
 *       carrying {@code /townaccept claim-4821} is an invitation to type {@code claim-4822} and
 *       approve something nobody offered them.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So the action is registered here against an opaque token and, usually, against the one player
 * allowed to click it. The button runs one shared command. Guessing somebody else's button means
 * guessing a random 128-bit token <em>and</em> being the player it was bound to.
 *
 * <h2>Bounded, swept, and forgotten</h2>
 * Tokens expire, are swept on a timer, are dropped when their owner logs out, and the whole registry
 * is capped — a plugin looping over an offer it keeps re-sending must not be able to fill the heap
 * with closures. When the cap is reached the oldest go first, because the newest button is the one
 * the player is looking at.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. Everything is done under this object's monitor, including running the
 * action's bookkeeping — a one-shot button clicked by eight threads at once runs exactly once.
 * The action itself runs outside the lock, so a slow callback cannot block other players' clicks.
