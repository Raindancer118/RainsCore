/**
 * The base for every screen in every one of these plugins.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is only one of these now</h2>
 * There were five: the claims module's, the core's, the ghast lines', homes' and the resourcepack
 * manager's. Each had its own idea of what a window title was, where Back went, whether the bottom
 * row was safe to write to, and what a filler pane looked like — so the same plugin looked like five
 * plugins, and a fix to one of them stayed in that one. This is the claims framework, which was the
 * most evolved of the five, with its arithmetic pulled out into {@link MenuLayout} so it can be
 * tested without a server.
 *
 * <h2>The grammar</h2>
 * See {@link MenuLayout} for the grid. Three rules make it hold:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The chrome row is not a page's business.</b> {@link #set} refuses it outright and the
 *       framework paints it after {@link #render()} returns. The old framework had the navigation
 *       as a method a subclass called at the end, which meant a page could quietly overwrite its own
 *       Back button — and a paged list did exactly that to its own page arrows.</li>
 *   <li><b>A band is an order, not a slot.</b> {@link #band} takes a column meaning "this comes
 *       third", and the band is centred once {@code render()} has decided which of its buttons this
 *       viewer actually gets to see.</li>
 *   <li><b>A button a viewer may not use is shown, greyed, with the reason</b> — see the four-argument
 *       {@link #band}. A live-looking button that answers a click with an error is worse.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Identity</h2>
 * Being the {@link InventoryHolder} is what lets {@link MenuListener} recognise our own inventories
 * without keeping a registry of open views — and therefore without holding {@link Player} references
 * that would pin a whole world in the heap.
