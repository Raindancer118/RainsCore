/**
 * The second half of a team's identity, and the reason a server is not limited to sixteen teams.
 *
 * <h2>Why colour alone runs out</h2>
 * {@link TeamColour} has sixteen values and cannot have more. That is not a decision anybody here made:
 * Minecraft's chat colours, scoreboard team colours and dyes are a set of sixteen, and a seventeenth "colour"
 * would either be a duplicate under another name or a hex value that a nametag and a chat prefix cannot
 * render. A tournament that wanted twenty teams had to either give two of them the same colour — which is the
 * one thing colour exists to prevent — or refuse to found the seventeenth.
 *
 * <p>An emblem is a character, and characters do not run out. Sixteen colours against the fourteen emblems
 * below is <b>224 identities</b> that are distinguishable at a glance, and a red ♦ is as obviously not a red
 * ♣ as a red is not a blue.
 *
 * <h2>Why a symbol rather than, say, a number</h2>
 * Because it has to work in the three places a team is seen, and only a symbol works in all of them:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A nametag above somebody's head</b>, read from across the arena, at an angle, moving. "Team 17" is
 *       unreadable there and ♦ is not.</li>
 *   <li><b>A scoreboard line</b>, where every character costs width somebody else's name needs.</li>
 *   <li><b>An inventory icon</b>, which is why each emblem also names a {@link Material} — a page of teams
 *       has to be scannable, and sixteen shulker boxes in fourteen colours is not.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All fourteen are in the Unicode range Minecraft's default font renders. That is the whole constraint on
 * the list and the reason it is a fixed enum rather than a string a server owner types: a glyph the client
 * cannot draw appears as a hollow box, and a team whose emblem is a hollow box is a team with no identity at
 * all — which nobody would discover until somebody joined it.
 *
 * @see TeamColour for the other half, and for why there are exactly sixteen of those
