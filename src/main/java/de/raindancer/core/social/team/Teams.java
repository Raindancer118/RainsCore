/**
 * A roster of named, coloured teams, held to one {@link TeamPolicy} at a time.
 *
 * <h2>The single source of truth for who is on which team</h2>
 * Every route in — a plugin's own API, an admin command, a player's menu click, random assignment — goes
 * through one instance of this class, and all of them are held to the same policy. Two paths that could
 * each independently decide "is this colour free" are two paths that can disagree about it, and a colour
 * clash is exactly the failure this class exists to make impossible: see {@link #create} and
 * {@link #setColour}, both of which refuse a taken colour outright rather than picking a different one on
 * the caller's behalf.
 *
 * <h2>Why this moved out of one Hunger Games module and into Core</h2>
 * A tournament's teams, a bedwars match's teams, a clan and a party had each been written as their own
 * copy of the same hard parts — membership, exclusive colours, captains, random assignment, the outcome
 * vocabulary for a refusal — with a handful of numbers and booleans as the only real difference. Written
 * separately, each copy got one of the hard parts subtly wrong: the copy where a colour clash silently
 * reassigns, the copy where two clicks in one tick both pass the size check, the copy where a rename loses
 * the members. This class owns the hard parts once; {@link TeamPolicy} carries what differs.
 *
 * <h2>The three things this class is handed, and why each is what it is</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code policy} is a supplier rather than a value, because a reload can swap it out from under a live
 * roster — an owner raising the team-size cap because fewer people showed up than expected — and every
 * team operation has to see the current rules, not whichever ones were current when the roster was
 * built.</li>
 * <li>{@code frozen} is a fact about the moment, not a rule, and is asked for separately from the policy on
 * purpose. A tournament's teams stop being editable when a round starts and a bedwars match's the moment
 * the game begins, and neither is a number or a boolean that belongs in {@link TeamPolicy} — it is a
 * decision the owning plugin already has to make for its own reasons, and repeating it here as a second
 * boolean would be a second place for the two to disagree.</li>
 * <li>{@code isEligible} is the host's business and this class never knows why: a whitelisted tribute, a
 * player in the match, somebody not already banned from clans. This class only asks the question and acts
 * on the answer.</li>
 * </ul>
