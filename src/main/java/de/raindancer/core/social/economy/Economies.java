/**

 * <p>Static and process-wide for the same reason as {@code ProfileExtensions}: modules are hosted by
 * whichever plugin loaded them, and there is one server's worth of money however many plugins are
 * involved.
 *
 * <p>Several providers may register; the newest answers and the one before it takes over again when it
 * retracts — so a module reloaded in place does not leave the server without money for the moment in
 * between, and a second economy plugin installed by mistake does not silently split the accounts in
 * two: whichever answers is logged.
