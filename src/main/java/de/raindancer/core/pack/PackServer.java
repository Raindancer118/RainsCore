/**
 * A small read-only web server for the built pack.
 *
 * <h2>Why the library serves it at all</h2>
 * Because the pack is built here, on this machine, and the client has to download it from somewhere.
 * The alternative is telling every server owner to set up a web server and keep a URL in step with a
 * file that changes whenever a plugin is added — which is exactly the sort of manual step that is
 * wrong six months later and produces a "pack failed to download" that nobody can trace.
 *
 * <p>An owner who already has a web server or a CDN can still use it: set a public address, or do
 * not start this at all and hand out your own URL.
 *
 * <h2>What it will not do</h2>
 * {@code GET} and {@code HEAD}, for one file name, under one prefix. No listing, no writes, and a
 * name containing a slash or a {@code ..} is refused before the filesystem is touched — then the
 * resolved path is checked to be inside the folder anyway. This is the only part of the library that
 * opens a port; serving files by name from a request is how a pack server becomes a way to read
 * {@code server.properties}, so it is deliberately dull.
 *
 * <h2>Where this came from</h2>
 * Adapted from {@code RainsResourcepackManager}, which had it first and had it right. Changed here:
 * the logger, port 0 support so a test can have the operating system pick a free port, and a public
 * address separate from the bind address — because binding to {@code 0.0.0.0} must not become the
 * URL a client is told to download from.
