/**
 * The one owner of what is on a player's screen.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is Core's and not a pack manager's</h2>
 * Because a player has one resource pack. The moment two plugins each have assets — a claims module
 * with menu icons, a record seller with custom discs — whichever sends last wins and the other one's
 * textures are simply not there. Nothing errors, nothing logs, and the plugin that lost has no way
 * of finding out. That is the same collision as the action bar and the sidebar, and it gets the same
 * answer: plugins offer, this decides, and a conflict is something a server owner can read.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately not a pack <em>manager</em>. It does not browse catalogues, install packs
 * for players, or have opinions about where assets come from — a plugin doing that can still do it,
 * and contribute the result here.
 *
 * <h2>How a plugin uses it</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * core.resourcePacks().contribute(
 *         PackContribution.of("Claims", "icons", getDataFolder().toPath().resolve("icons.zip"))
 *                 .describedAs("The icons the claim menu uses"));
 * }</pre>
 * Contributing is all a plugin does. Building, serving and sending are this class's business, and
 * when to send is not a decision a plugin should be making per player.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. {@link #rebuild()} does real work on real files and blocks — call it off the
 * main thread; everything else is bookkeeping.
