/**
 * A pack that already exists somewhere, rather than one built here.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not a {@link PackContribution}</h2>
 * A contribution is a folder of assets a plugin hands over for Core to merge and serve. This is the
 * other thing entirely: one finished pack, made by hand, hosted somewhere else, that the whole server
 * wears. Core never sees its contents and has nothing to merge — all it does is pass the client a URL
 * and a hash.
 *
 * <p>It still goes through {@link ResourcePacks} rather than round it, and that is the whole point. A
 * player has <em>one</em> resource pack slot. A plugin that called {@code setResourcePack} itself would
 * work perfectly until anything contributed assets, at which point the two fight over that slot and
 * whoever sends last wins silently — exactly the collision this package exists to arbitrate.
 *
 * @param id   what the server calls it, so it can be replaced or withdrawn by name
 * @param url  where the client downloads it from; absolute, and used exactly as given
 * @param sha1 what it must hash to. Not optional: this is what a client caches by, and a pack sent
 *             without one is re-downloaded on every single join
