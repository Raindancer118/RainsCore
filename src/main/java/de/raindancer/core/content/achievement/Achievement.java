/**
 * Something a player can do that is worth telling them about.
 *
 * <h2>Why not a vanilla advancement</h2>
 * A vanilla advancement is a datapack JSON file keyed to vanilla triggers, which means "claim your
 * first plot" or "visit every stop on the ghast network" cannot be expressed at all — there is no
 * trigger for either. Generating the datapack from the server would also mean rewriting and
 * reloading it every time a plugin added one. So these are ours, and the toast that announces them
 * is a message rather than the vanilla popup.
 *
 * @param goal   how many of something is needed, or null for one that is simply done or not
 * @param hidden whether it stays out of the list until it is earned
