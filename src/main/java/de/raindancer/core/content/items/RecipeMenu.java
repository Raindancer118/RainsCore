/**
 * What a custom item is crafted from, as the three-by-three grid it actually is.
 *
 * <h2>Why Core owns this page</h2>
 * The same argument as the cues. Core owns {@link CustomItem}, {@link CustomItems} and
 * {@link ItemRecipes} — so a page that edits a recipe belongs here, once, for every plugin's items rather
 * than once per plugin. The Hunger Games plugin this replaces had a page for exactly one recipe
 * ({@code items.exmatrikulator.recipe}, three rows of text in a config file), and the port dropped it because
 * the item had moved into this registry and the registry had no screen.
 *
 * <h2>The mistake the grid makes easy, and what this page does about it</h2>
 * Nine slots, and only the middle filled, is not "one item in the middle" as far as Bukkit is concerned — it
 * is a three-by-three shape whose outer ring is empty, and the server refuses it with an exception naming none
 * of this. {@link ItemRecipes#crop} is what turns a drawn grid into the shape a server will accept, and this
 * page shows the cropped result <em>before</em> saving: a preview that disagrees with the result is worse than
 * no preview.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is saved until Save</h2>
 * The grid is edited in memory and written on one click, so backing out changes nothing — the same rule
 * {@code AmountChooser} follows, and the right one for a page where a wrong recipe means an item nobody can
 * make.
