/**
 * Every vote running on the server.
 *
 * <h2>Why Core owns this</h2>
 * Because the simplest useful version — an operator asks a question, everybody answers, the answer
 * with the most votes wins — is wanted by half the plugins on a server and is wrong in the same ways
 * every time it is rewritten: somebody votes twice, a changed vote is counted as two, the result is
 * read mid-write, or a tie quietly declares a winner. Each of those is a public argument rather than
 * a bug report.
 *
 * <p>It is also the thing the town council needs. "The council must approve a claim inside a town"
 * is a vote with a named electorate and a deadline, which is this class with a set passed in.
 *
 * <h2>Using it</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Vote vote = core.votes().open(op, "Reset the farm world?", List.of("Yes", "No"),
 *         Times.parse("2min").orElseThrow()).orElseThrow();
 *
 * core.votes().cast(vote.id(), player, "Yes");     // answers with a Ballot saying what happened
 * core.votes().sweep().forEach(this::announce);    // on a timer; each id once, as it ends
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread.
