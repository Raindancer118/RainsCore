/**
 * Which rows a store still has to write, and how to take that list without losing an entry.
 *
 * <h2>The mistake this exists to stop</h2>
 * Every store here keeps a set of the keys that have changed, so a save writes the rows that changed
 * rather than every row it has. The obvious way to write them is:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Set<K> writing = Set.copyOf(changed);   // snapshot
 * write(writing);
 * changed.removeAll(writing);             // and clear
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>That loses any change which arrives <em>while the write is running</em>. The key is already in
 * the snapshot, so marking it again is a no-op on the set; then {@code removeAll} takes the mark
 * away. The new value is never written, and nothing will write it again until somebody happens to
 * touch that row once more — which for a warp somebody renamed, or a ban somebody lifted, may be
 * never.
 *
 * <p>It is not a narrow window either. These writes go to disk, they are called from a timer, and
 * players are changing things the whole time.
 *
 * <h2>What this does instead</h2>
 * Takes each mark <em>off</em> the set as it collects it. A change arriving during the write puts its
 * key back, and the next save picks it up. The worst case is one row written twice, which costs
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>Found by a second review (agy) on 2026-08-03, in five stores at once — which is the argument for
 * it living in one place rather than being written out five times.
