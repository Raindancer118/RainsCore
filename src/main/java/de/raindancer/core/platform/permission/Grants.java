/**
 * Permissions this server has granted somebody, remembered across restarts.
 *
 * <h2>What this is not</h2>
 * <b>Not a permissions plugin.</b> No groups, no inheritance, no contexts, no wildcards, no negative
 * nodes — and it should never grow them itself. LuckPerms exists and is better at every one of those,
 * which is exactly why {@link LuckPermsGrantStore} hands this class's questions to LuckPerms rather than
 * this class reinventing any of it.
 *
 * <p>It layers rather than replaces. A server without LuckPerms gets {@link LocalGrantStore}: a list of
 * nodes granted to a named person, applied when they join, and still there tomorrow. A server that has
 * LuckPerms installed gets {@link LuckPermsGrantStore} instead, transparently — every caller of this
 * class asks the exact same questions either way and neither knows or needs to know which store is
 * underneath.
 *
 * <h2>Which store, and when that is decided</h2>
 * Chosen once, at construction, by whichever constructor is used — never re-decided afterwards. A server
 * that installs LuckPerms mid-session does not have its grants migrate under it; that only happens on
 * the restart LuckPerms needed anyway.
 *
 * <h2>Nodes are stored exactly as written</h2>
 * Deliberately not normalised. Bukkit compares permission strings literally, so lower-casing a node
 * here would silently grant one that does not exist — and the symptom is a moderator whose commands all
 * refuse them for no visible reason.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Read from permission checks, which happen on every command and inside render loops; written from
 * commands and menu clicks. Safe from any thread. {@link #load} and {@link #flush} touch disk (or, with
 * LuckPerms, the network) and should not be called on the server thread.
