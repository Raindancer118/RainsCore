/**
 * One command, as it appears in the directory: a name, a sentence, and its options.
 *
 * <h2>Why a sentence and not a paragraph</h2>
 * Because the directory is a directory. Somebody opening it is trying to remember whether the
 * command is {@code /warp} or {@code /warps}, not to learn what warping is — and a page of prose per
 * command turns thirty commands into forty pages nobody scrolls through. The explaining is the
 * manual's job; this says what exists, and every option it takes.
 *
 * <p>The sentence is therefore held to one: {@link #of} refuses a second full stop's worth of text,
 * loudly, at the moment the command is declared rather than in a book somebody is reading.
 *
 * <h2>Why the options are strings</h2>
 * They are usage lines — {@code "pack <creature> [how many]"} — and a usage line is what a reader
 * needs to see. Modelling arguments properly would buy nothing here: nothing validates against these,
 * they are printed, and Brigadier already owns the real grammar.
