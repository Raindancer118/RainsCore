 * One thing a moderator did, and whether it still applies.

 * <h2>Why lifting adds rather than deletes</h2>
 * A lifted ban is not a ban that never happened. Keeping the record — who gave it, why, who lifted
 * it and why — is the difference between a moderation system and a set of flags, and it is what
 * makes the second offence answerable: "you were banned for this in March" is only available if
 * March is still written down.
 *
 * @param endsAt   when it stops applying; null for a punishment that never does
 * @param liftedAt when a moderator ended it early, if one did
