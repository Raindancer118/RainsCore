/**
 * Being properly not here.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is Core's</h2>
 * Because vanish is not one feature — it is a promise every other feature has to keep. Somebody
 * hidden who still appears in the tablist, still counts in "3 players online", or whose join message
 * went out anyway is not hidden, and each of those belongs to a different subsystem. Only the thing
 * that owns the tablist, the chat and the player list can make the promise hold.
 *
 * <p>The practical consequence for a plugin is one line: ask {@link #visibleOf} instead of
 * {@code Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()}, and {@link #isVanished} before mentioning anybody. Nine plugins
 * each keeping their own set is nine chances for five of them to forget.
 *
 * <h2>Why the extras are optional</h2>
 * Flight, gamemode and the rest come apart in practice: somebody may want to be invisible without
 * flying, or to look at a build in creative without being hidden. Bundling them means the one you
 * did not want comes along too, and turning it off afterwards is what leaves a moderator stuck in
 * survival at bedrock. Flight is remembered as it was and put back exactly as it was found.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread.
