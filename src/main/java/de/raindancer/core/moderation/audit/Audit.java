/**
 * A record of what was done on this server, and who did it.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 * Two questions, asked when something has already gone wrong: <b>what has this moderator been
 * doing</b>, and <b>what has been done to this player</b>. Both are unanswerable from an ordinary
 * logfile, which is a stream of sentences with no structure to search — so this keeps the actor, the
 * subject and the feature as fields and generates the sentence when somebody wants to read one.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately not the ordinary log. The logfile is for the server operator debugging the
 * server; this is for the person asking who took the diamonds. They have different retention, they
 * are read in different ways, and mixing them means neither is good at its job.
 *
 * <h2>Why recording does not touch the disk</h2>
 * Because it is called from wherever the action happened — a click handler, a command, a login — and
 * those are on threads that are running the world. {@link #record} appends to a queue and returns;
 * {@link #flush()} writes whatever has gathered, in one transaction, off the server's threads and on
 * a timer.
 *
 * <p>That trades a few seconds of durability for never stalling a region, which is the right way
 * round: an audit line lost to a crash is an inconvenience, and a region stalling on an fsync every
 * time somebody opens a menu is a server nobody plays on. A clean shutdown flushes, so the only way
 * to lose one is a kill.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is written even when nobody will ever read it</h2>
 * Because the value of an audit log is entirely in already having it. Nobody turns one on before the
 * incident.
