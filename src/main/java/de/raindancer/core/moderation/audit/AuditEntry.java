/**
 * One thing somebody did.
 *
 * <h2>Why the who and the what are columns rather than a sentence</h2>
 * The obvious way to write an audit log is a line of prose: "Steve edited Alex's inventory". It reads
 * well and it cannot be searched. The questions this exists to answer are "what has this moderator
 * done" and "what has been done to this player", and neither can be asked of a sentence without
 * guessing at its grammar.
 *
 * <p>So the actor, the subject and the feature are fields, and the sentence is generated from them
 * when somebody wants to read one.
 *
 * <h2>Why the names are kept as well as the UUIDs</h2>
 * Because a UUID is the only thing that stays the same when somebody changes their name, and a name
 * is the only thing anybody reading a log a year later will recognise. Keeping just the UUID means a
 * log nobody can read; keeping just the name means a log that quietly attributes one person's
 * actions to whoever holds that name now. Both, and the name is what it was <em>at the time</em>.
 *
 * @param id          what the journal called it; 0 for an entry not written yet
 * @param at          when it happened
 * @param feature     which part of the server — {@code "invsee"}, {@code "punishment"}, {@code "vanish"}
 * @param action      what was done, in that feature's own words — {@code "opened"}, {@code "banned"}
 * @param actor       who did it; null for something the server did by itself
 * @param actorName   what they were called at the time
 * @param subject     who it was done to, when it was done to somebody
 * @param subjectName what they were called at the time
 * @param detail      one line for a human to read
 * @param world       where, when that means anything
 * @param fields      whatever else this action needs remembered, searchable rather than prose
