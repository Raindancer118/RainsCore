/**
 * Whether a punishment actually stops somebody, and what they are told when it does.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * Because for a while it did not, and that was the real gap. {@link Punishments} recorded a ban
 * perfectly — the reason, the length, who lifted it and when — and <em>nothing anywhere stopped a
 * banned player from joining</em>. A ban that does not ban is worse than no ban at all, because
 * everybody involved believes it worked.
 *
 * <p>It also has to live here rather than in whichever plugin owns the moderation commands. Any
 * plugin can call {@link Punishments#punish}: the claims module freezing somebody's hands while a
 * grief is investigated is a reasonable thing for it to do, and it should not have to write its own
 * listeners to make that mean anything. Written once, every plugin's punishments are enforced.
 *
 * <h2>Why the decision is separate from the listeners</h2>
 * "May this player join, and if not what do they see" is a question about a punishment and a clock.
 * The Bukkit handler that asks it is three lines and needs a server. Everything worth getting right
 * is on this side of that line, which is why this class has no Bukkit types in it beyond a
 * {@link Component}.
 *
 * <h2>Switching it off</h2>
 * A server already driving punishments from somewhere else can turn enforcement off, per kind or
 * altogether, and keep the record. The record is useful on its own — it is the history a moderator
 * reads — so recording and enforcing are deliberately separate switches.
