/**
 * Bans, mutes, freezes, and the record of who did what.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is here rather than in a moderation plugin</h2>
 * Every plugin that can refuse a player something eventually grows its own way of remembering that
 * it refused them. Separately, that means several files that disagree about whether somebody is
 * muted, several answers to "when does this end", and nowhere to look when a player asks why they
 * cannot build. Any plugin can ask this one, and the claims module can freeze somebody's hands
 * without having an opinion about whether they should be on the server at all.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing is ever deleted</h2>
 * Lifting a ban adds the lifting to it; the ban stays. That is what makes a second offence
 * answerable, and it is the difference between this and a set of flags.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. Each player's record is a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} — punishments are
 * read constantly (every join, every chat message) and written rarely, which is exactly what that
 * list is for.
