/**
 * Looking inside somebody's inventory — online or not.
 *
 * <h2>What this class is for</h2>
 * The three things that make an invsee safe live in three separate classes, each testable without a
 * server: who may edit ({@link InventoryViews}), what happens to an offline edit when its owner logs
 * back in ({@link OfflineEdits}), and where the items come from ({@link InventorySource}). This is
 * the one place that knows all three, and the only place that has to decide which kind of player is
 * being looked at.
 *
 * <h2>Why the offline half exists at all</h2>
 * Because the players a moderator most needs to look at are exactly the ones who have logged out.
 * "Only while they are online" sounds like a small gap and is the half that matters — somebody
 * reported after they left, a duplication traced through the people who received the items,
 * belongings to give back to a returning player.
 *
 * <p>Nobody is ever stopped from joining to make that work. If somebody logs in while their saved
 * inventory is open in a window, the window shuts and the edit is dropped unwritten — see
 * {@link #somebodyJoined}.
