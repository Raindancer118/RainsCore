/**
 * One moderator's window onto one player's inventory.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not a {@code Menu}</h2>
 * Every other screen in these plugins is a set of buttons, and the framework for those cancels every
 * click by design — which is exactly right for a menu and exactly wrong here, where the point is to
 * be able to take a stolen item out. This is the one window in the codebase where a click may move a
 * real item, so it is written out rather than fitted to a framework whose first rule it has to
 * break.
 *
 * <h2>How a change reaches the player</h2>
 * Two different ways, because the two cases fail differently:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Online:</b> each change is pushed straight onto the live inventory. Writing the whole
 *       snapshot back instead would undo anything its owner picked up while the moderator was
 *       looking.</li>
 *   <li><b>Offline:</b> changes go into the snapshot, and the file is written once, when the window
 *       closes. One write instead of one per click, and the player is held out of the server for
 *       the whole of it — see {@link OfflineEdits}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The window is read after the click rather than the click being interpreted. Minecraft has
 * roughly a dozen ways to move an item — shift-click, number keys, double-click gathering, drags
 * that cross both inventories — and a handler that works out what each of them meant is a handler
 * that gets one of them wrong. What actually ended up in the window is not ambiguous.
