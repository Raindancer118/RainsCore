/**
 * Everything a plugin here says in chat, and the only way it says it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * There were five of these: {@code Notifier}, claims' {@code Messages}, RRP's {@code Msg}, and a
 * {@code Chrome} class copied three times between homes, TPA and the ghast lines. Each had its own
 * idea of what a prefix was and which of them escaped player-supplied text before pasting it into
 * MiniMessage — the last being a formatting injection waiting to happen, since a home called
 * {@code <red>} was being parsed as markup by two of the five.
 *
 * <h2>This is chat. The action bar is somewhere else.</h2>
 * An earlier version of this class routed "personal" messages to the action bar behind a single
 * server-wide setting, inherited from {@code smpcore.util.Feedback}. That was wrong twice over: one
 * boolean cannot decide for every message a plugin sends, and most messages do not belong above the
 * hotbar at all. The rule now is a question the caller answers at the call site — <b>does this still
 * matter a second later?</b>
 *
 * <table border="1">
 *   <caption>Where a message goes</caption>
 *   <tr><th>{@link de.raindancer.core.actionbar.ActionBars}</th><th>Here</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>A teleport countdown, a cast bar, progress</td>
 *       <td>"Home set", "Request sent to Bentex_OG"</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Flight commentary while a ghast is in the air</td>
 *       <td>A refusal the player may want to read twice</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>"You have entered Raindancer118's claim"</td>
 *       <td>Lists, headings, manuals — anything with rows</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>A warning about where the player is standing now</td>
 *       <td>Anything naming another player who might reply</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <h2>Untrusted text</h2>
 * Anything a player typed — a home name, a claim name, a pack's title, another plugin's error —
 * goes in through {@link #arg}, never concatenated into the template. {@link #arg} uses
 * {@link Placeholder#unparsed}, so a claim called {@code <rainbow>} shows up as those nine
 * characters instead of recolouring the rest of the line, and an unclosed tag cannot swallow the
 * message it was pasted into.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Building a component is safe from any thread, and so is sending: nothing here touches the world,
 * so none of it needs a region thread.
